<h3>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ <br> I'm Sam </h3>

<h5>I'm a mechanical engineer who likes to build stuff. I'm learning how to write embedded software to further my career and enhance my projects. So far I've made a library for the STM32F4 that I continuously add to and I've started working on a data acquisition system that I will be using for my mountain bike.</h5>
